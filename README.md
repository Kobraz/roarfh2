# Square Eyes - Cross-Course Project

![image](https://roarfh-portifolio.netlify.app/images/ccProject.png)

This project was about taking the old Square Eyes website and modify it. This was done by inserting the movies images and information into a WordPress site. Then I should get the API from the WordPress site and use it to get the information back to the Square Eyes website.

## Description

I created an WordPress to hold the movies information, this includeing the cover images, description text and more.

Next step was replacing my content with the content I got from the WordPress API.

I also made another page to the project for filtering movies based on genre. So when you click on the genre "Action" you will se every movies in this genre.

## Getting Started

### Installing

1. Create and clone the repo:

I first made a new repo on GitHub and cloned it to local. Then I added a new site on Netlify.com and connected to my repo.

The next step was to copy my files from the first project (same site, that I should modify now). THen I had to commit and push the files in GitHub.

2. Install the dependencies:

Then I started creating a WordPress installation on my private server.

I installed the woocommerce plugin to my WordPress installation to make get the webshop-features and uploded images and all the information needed.

After doing this I had to get the API from my WordPress installation. Once I succeed with that I started fetching the content from the API using JavaScript.

Then I had to do some work in my HTML to remove the hardcoded images and information and make the HTML ready to receive the information from the API through the JavaScript files.
