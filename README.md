# Square Eyes - Cross-Course Project

![image](https://roarfh-portifolio.netlify.app/images/ccProject.png)

This project was about taking the old Square Eyes website and modify it. This was done by inserting the movies images and information into a WordPress site. Then I should get the API from the WordPress site and use it to get the information back to the Square Eyes website.

## Description

I created an WordPress to hold the movies information, this includeing the cover images, description text and more.

Next step was replacing my content with the content I got from the WordPress API.

I also made another page to the project for filtering movies based on genre. So when you click on the genre "Action" you will se every movies in this genre.

## Getting Started

### Installing

I first made a new repo on GitHub and cloned it to local. Then I added a new site on Netlify.com and connected to my repo.

The next step was to copy my files from the first project (same site, that I should modify now). THen I had to commit
